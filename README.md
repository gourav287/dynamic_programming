# dynamic_programming
This repository contains most of the codes that I did or will do practice in dynamic programming
The questions have been taken from different coding websites such as hackerrank, codechef, codeforces and from different courses on udemy, coursera, etc.

Dynamic programming is nothing but the optimization of plain recurrsion. The idea is to store values for the subproblems so that we do not have to execute them more than once. This saves our code from a lot of unnecessary processing.
